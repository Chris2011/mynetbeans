OpenIDE-Module-Display-Category=Base IDE
OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    In Java 6 a new class was introduced - java.awt.Desktop, using which you can leave file handling to the underlying operating system's file associations.\n\
    For ex. \
    Notepad can be the assigned editor for .txt files. \
    Or you can view the System file explorer from the selected node. \
    You might want to view files within the browser. \n\n\
    This plugin has four actions, Open, Browse, Edit and send by mail. \
    Each of these uses the Desktop.edit/open, browse and mail methods.\n\n\
    Caveat Emptor - Known issues :\n1. \
    Behaviour is not guaranteed to be as expected. \
    For example browse and open can do the same thing - open in the default editor. \
    My testing has shown that only html and xml files open properly in browser.\n2. \
    Mail - Selected file is not intriduced as an attachment since the mailto protocol does not support attachments. \n3. \
    There are no options to set. \
    What ever is set on the operating system will be used. \n4. \
    When file association are not set; For example for manifest.mf file there might not be a file association. \
    In these case you get an IOException which is shown to the user. \n5. \
    Tested Platforms - Netbeans 8 and Java SE 7 and up. \
    The plugin has been developer tested on Win 7, Windows 8, Mac OS X - Yosemite.\n6. \
    BIG NOTE: If an application is not associated with the given file, the behaviour is non-consistent. \
    Some times the Open With dialog appears, sometimes hiddent behind the IDE and many times, throws Exception\n\nSubmit issues at https://github.com/manikantannaren/mynetbeans/issues with Prefix [NB-Use-System-Dekstop]
